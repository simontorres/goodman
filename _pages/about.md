The Goodman Spectrocopic Pipeline is SOAR's response to the Goodman HTS users
who have had to develop their own tools to process the data. Our goal is to
provide fully-reduced and science-ready spectroscopic data.

It's been developed by SOAR's Astronomical Software Development Team in
La Serena, Chile.

Current Released Version is 1.0b1 (first Beta).

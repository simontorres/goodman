Always check the branch other than master.\r\n\r\nThe Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph is an imaging spectrograph\r\n if you wish to know more about the instrument please check the \r\n [SOAR website](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/content/goodman-high-throughput-spectrograph)\r\n\r\n## What is contained in this package?\r\n\r\nThis repository contains tools for spectroscopy, but after the data is \r\nreduced, i.e. bias and flat corrected, for that part please use \r\n[David Sanmartim's](link) github repository.\r\n\r\n#### redspec.py  \r\n Spectra extraction and wavelength calibration\r\n\r\n## How to use it?\r\n\r\nPlace the files in your system's **$PATH** variable and then you can call it from anywhere in your system\r\n\r\n## Important Notes\r\n\r\nNeeds python2.7 and a newer version of numpy1.12.0 otherwise there will\r\nbe problems with numpy.linspace\r\n",
